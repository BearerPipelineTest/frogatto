//This object is automatically spawned by "sound-sources" in-game; it doesn't need to manually be placed by people editing levels, nor does it need to be spawned by object-writers who are using sound-sources to give in-game objects a tracked sound.  This coordinates multiple instances of a single sound so that only one instance of them plays at a given time, passing control to a new one if one of them is going to be removed.

			Without this logic, our stereo separation works fine for singular sound sources, but it won't correctly combine the contributions of multiple sounds.  The failure case lies in having a loudest sound to (for example) the right, which gives a final volume of [0.2, 1.0], and then having a second-loudest sound to the left, which gives [0.5, 0.0].  Effectively the loudness of the leftward sound would be completely disregarded, and it would feel to the player that it was muted.
			
			Instead, we partition the gamespace into 'sounds left of the player' and 'sounds to the right'.  We then take the loudest of both, and max() their values against each other, so if there's a sound of some considerable volume coming from each side, it sounds like that to the player.
