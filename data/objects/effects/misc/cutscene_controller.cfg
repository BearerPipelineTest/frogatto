/*
	The cutscene controller is an object which will house all of the scripting for an off-level cutscene.  It's designed to be triggered by an `invisible_observer`, once said observer gets transported to a new level.  It will run the cutscene, and then trigger a `cutscene_finished` property in the observer.
	
	These objects are implemented as a child of the `pullable` prototype, because an extremely common need within cutscenes is to trigger an event (to show a gate or whatnot opening).  I think it's completely viable to run these without actually using any of the pullable functionality, but I'm undecided as to whether or not we'll proceed with that as our modus operandi.
