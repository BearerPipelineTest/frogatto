We're relying on `object_level_collisions` to kill this, but when it was perfectly centered on a 16x16 square of valid pixels, it was falling through solid terrain.  By carefully altering the image to have some transparent pixels below the sprite, and extending our sprite box down into that, we've solved this problem.
