		If we're going to do this, we need to ensure that all possible conversations will actually have a good place for the character to walk to by actually testing the level - checking if there's solid ground in the target spot, and also testing if there's an obstruction in the way.  We basically have two cases to check for:
			• is the speaker at a cliff-edge where the player walking in that direction risks the player falling off the cliff?
			• is the speaker flush against the wall, and would the player trying to speak to them from the wrong direction cause the player to ram into the wall?

		We also have heuristics based on ourself, rather than the player; which affect which order we test things in (with a first-come first-served system for preferentially picking one or the other).  If our turning behavior allows us to turn towards the player, then if the player comes up behind us, we'll turn and face them.  But if we're someone who doesn't turn (since either a few NPCs look ugly doing so (since some 'standing' animations are really leaning-against-a-tree or somesuch), or because the NPC in question is deeply intent on something), then we make the player first try the direction which would make them walk to the other side of us.
